All questions: We obtained data from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anoopjohny/meteorite-landings, the website providing meteor data,
gathered by NASA and collaborators, verified for validity by NASA scientists.
Our second data frame, obtained from a friend at UW, used a CSV file of continents with geo-location.

The friend gathered this data for their RSO project, but the original data collector is unknown.
Question 1: The Meteorites data frame has two variables, year and impacts. Year indicates the year
a meteor was observed on Earth, and impact denotes the number of impacts or observations that year.
Displaying the first 5 rows, there are 253 years of observations with 16 missing or invalid entries.

Question 2: The meteorDataWithCounts data frame has 8 variables. Year represents the year a meteor
was spotted or found, name is the meteor's name, and fall indicates if it was seen in the sky or found.
Lat and Long represent the latitude and longitude of the meteor, continent is where it was found or seen,
meteor count is the count for each continent, and population represents the continent's population.
There were 7315 missing or invalid entries; unknown options exist if coordinates don't match any continent.
Filtering out missing long/lat coordinates ensures each meteor has a location, useful for determining
where to find meteors and the likelihood of seeing one. Filtering by Unknown gives meteors outside continents.

Question 3: found_metorites represents meteors found in North America on the ground,
and fell_meteorites represent falling meteors in North America. Both data frames share variables.
Name, ID, nameType, recclass, and mass (g) are common. Fall/found, reclat, and reclong vary.
For found_meteorites, there were 1646 entries with 13 invalid entries, missing mass (g) and year.
For fell_meteorites, there were 184 sightings with only 1 invalid entry missing mass (g).
This case is peculiar, and reasons for the missing data could range from tampering to loss.
