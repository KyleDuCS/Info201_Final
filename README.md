# Info201_Final AB-1

This project will analyze meteor observations throughout the world. We will analyze how frequent observations are per year. This will help us determine how often a scientist can expect to see a meteor. This will also help scientists conclude the general trend of observing meteors. This will better prepare scientists for meteor observations. We will also find the heaviest meteor because this would be helpful for scientists to determine the general weight of meteors found on Earth. This can help scientists determine how much meteorite material they need for their tests. They can also determine how much meteorite material is on Earth. They can also use this to determine how many meteor samples they need to collect to conduct their tests. We will also graph the ratio of fallen vs found meteors on Earth. This is the ratio of meteors falling in the sky vs the meteors found on the ground. We will also graph how many meteors are found per continent and their types. This will help scientists determine where to search for specific meteor types. This will also help scientists determine which continent to invest their resources in. This will help them more effectively distribute their resources. Finally, we will plot all of the meteor findings in North America. 

Some key takeaways from this project are that Antarctica and Africa are the most common contients to find meteors. Antarctica is most likely the place for the most reliable meteors since there is no permanent population. This means there's no one there who can lie about the authenticity of a meteor. Furthermore, meteor observations have only increased in recent decades. This is most likely due to better technology and knowledge about meteor patterns. Scientists should be able to identify meteors more accurately now compared to the past. Finally, meteor observations in the USA are most likely to occur in Texas and the central region of America. There is a chance for a meteor to strike a population center but the chances are low. Most meteor observations in the USA are within the southern central plains area.
